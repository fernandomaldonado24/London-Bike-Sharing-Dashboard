# London-Bike-Sharing-Dashboard
Bike usage in London peaks in summer and drops in winter, with more rides on non-holidays. Demand is highest during rush hours (7-9 AM, 5-6 PM) on weekdays and moderate from 10 AM to 4 PM on weekends. Higher temperatures and scattered clouds increase usage, while patterns stay consistent across seasons, with a winter decline.
